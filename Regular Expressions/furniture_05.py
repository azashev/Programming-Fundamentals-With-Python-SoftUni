# Write a program that calculates the total cost of bought furniture.
# You will be given information about each purchase on separate lines until you receive the command "Purchase".
# Valid information should be in the format:
# ">>{furniture_name}<<{price}!{quantity}".
#
# The price could be a floating-point or integer number.
# You should store the names of the furniture and the total price.
#
# In the end, print the name of each bought furniture and the total cost, formatted to the second decimal point:
# "Bought furniture:
# {1st name}
# {2nd name}
# â€¦
# {N name}
# Total money spend: {total_cost}"

# Solution one:

    if match:

# Solution two:

# while not command == "Purchase":

#     if match:
#         furniture.append(match[0][0])
#         price = float(match[0][1])
#         quantity = int(match[0][2])
